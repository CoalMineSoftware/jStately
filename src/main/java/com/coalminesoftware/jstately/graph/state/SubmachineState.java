/** Interface for a state that causes a "nested" state machine to be run.  When a SubmachineState is entered, the state
 * graph provided by {@link #getStateGraph()} is run in a new state machine.  The evaluation of inputs on the outer
 * machine is delegated to the nested machine until the nested machine reaches a {@link FinalState}, at which point the
 * value of {@link FinalState#getResult()} is evaluated as an input on the outer machine.  The state graph provided by
 * {@link #getStateGraph()} can also contain SubmachineStates, allowing a practically unlimited amount of nesting. */
